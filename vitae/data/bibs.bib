	Abstract = {Common vibration features such as natural frequencies and mode shapes as well as quantities derived from them are not very sensitive to crack-type damage until the damage is so large that it can become catastrophic. Several research groups have studied the effects of crack type damage on bladed disks. Fatigue cracks typically have very little, if any, loss of material, and thus they do not provide for easy inspection of visual change. The cracks do become observable when looking at their dynamic behavior: opening and closing during the vibration cycle. Opening and closing of the crack results in very localized nonlinear elastic behavior. A model of such behavior is a bilinear local modulus. Beams with cracks are well known to have such nonlinearities. The displacement of the flange surface on the downstream side of the hub is prescribed as a periodic function of time. This simulates the disk being clamped in a fixture that is mounted on the shaker and moving in the axial direction.},

	Abstract = {Scheduled and unscheduled maintenance actions are a significant cost for gas turbines. Advanced life prediction capabilities help to mitigate these costs. However, the protective thermal and damping coatings applied to the turbine rotors which can help significantly extend component life simultaneously increase the difficulty of modeling the behavior of the components due to the nonlinearity they introduce. The purpose of this research is to expand finite element modeling and analysis of coated turbine blades and blisks such that it incorporates a nonlinear constitutive law for coatings and to solve the improved model for the frequency response using the harmonic balance method. The improved model can be used to both optimize the coating used within the operating conditions of the turbine and improve life prediction capabilities of the system. &copy; 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

	Abstract = {Large rigid body-like motions couple with potentially significant deections are com- monplace amongst ornithopters in both nature and laboratories. In the highly weight- constrained designs of ornithopters, accurate modeling of dynamic interplay between the control, actuation, mechanisms, and exible wing will be necessary for development of control laws whose feedback will be based on system states far removed from the true ob- jectives of the control. Further, models developed for control law design will be restricted to low-order models applying modal and other gross-behavior approximations. The following work adjusts the exible model used in prior efiorts in developing a system of dynamic equations that allow micro air vehicle (MAV) onithopter designers to match drive motors to loads produced by exible apping wing spars. The model can be used to examine the coupled system-level behavior of brushed DC motors, gear trains, and any number of linkages and exible wing spars. A Lagrangian approach is used to derive the governing differential equations of motion for a class of ornithopter drive systems. Results of prior theoretical work and prior experimental work are compared to the updated theory. The results show that the differential equations correctly predict major trends in observed motor speed and wing spar structural deformation over the course of each wingbeat and demonstrate the importance of using the correct modal structure representations. It is shown that coupling between motor speed, wing loads, and structural exibility cause the aerodynamic forces encountered by the wing spars to depart from those predicted by rigid-spar and constant-velocity-motor-based kinematic simulations and demonstrate further the importance of proper reduced order spar model development. The work has ramifications to implementation of model reduction techniques to more complex geometries modeled using finite elements. &copy;2012 AIAA.},

Existing signature profiles for the bilinear model are reproduced with higher resolution, and new features are observed. Different boundary conditions are evaluated with the new method and compared to published results. Although similar, there are still discrepancies that remain and will need to be investigated. Overall, the proposed method for modeling and identifying fatigue cracks in beams has been improved, but will require validation against physical experiments before being used on more complicated structures such as bladed disks.},

	Abstract = {Fatigue damage is a central concern for turbomachinery blisk safety, and inspection methods used to identify such damage are both too slow and too expensive. The high costs of implementation and higher costs for failure to detect fatigue damage demonstrate the need for an automated, offline structural health monitoring system capable of reducing costs and improving results. For such a system to be possible, an efficient framework must be developed that is capable of producing the necessary data libraries within reasonable a timeframe. Toward this purpose, fatigue cracks in beams have been modeled by modifying the inputs to the structure rather than the structure model itself to produce the total response. To provide a more robust justification for the assumed self-excitation model, a different approach with a perturbed area moment of inertia was also investigated. A summary of previous and current work outlines these methods, highlights successful cases, and identifies some of the remaining challenges tackled in this research. The perturbation method is further explored with a numerical solution. Experimentation is continued to produce more results to provide more data for validation of simulation results. The experimental techniques used are found to introduce harmonics in addition to those induced by fatigue damage, and methods are investigated to remove them in future testing. The numerical solution to the perturbation model discussed behaves unexpectedly, so more investigation will be necessary if it is to serve as a suitable model for fatigue damaged structures.},

Although the time savings are considerable, and the method has proven capable of correctly identifying fatigue cracks over an effective region in data generated by a more traditional dual-model approach, additional refinement is needed. The self-excitation terms are no longer assumed, but are now derived by considering damage as a perturbation of the area moment of inertia. Alternative definitions for the spectral signature are con- sidered, and a new type of profile is developed to permit validation against experimental data from a single damaged beam. Some experimental data is obtained, though the in- put has spectral distortion. Although the simulation and experimental results are similar, there are still discrepancies that remain and will need to be investigated. Overall, more experimental results are needed to validate and improve the investigated method before it can be applied to more complicated structures such as bladed disks. &copy; 2012 AIAA.},

	Abstract = {Fatigue damage is a critical problem for turbomachinery blisks. Although methods exist to manage the associated risks, they are slow, costly, and imperfect. An automated non- destructive evaluation (NDE) or structural health monitoring (SHM) method is therefore sought to not only improve current identification capabilities, but also to reduce associated costs. The conceptual framework for such a method includes amassing large data libraries of simulation response data for a given structure, which is then made available for an artificial neural network during the automated inspection. When properly tuned and calibrated, it is expected such a system will be able to identify the presence, location, and severity of fatigue damage in turbomachinery bladed disks. However, a fast method for producing the necessary data libraries is prerequisite. To lay the foundation for such a system, this team has investigated several effcient methods for simulating the nonlinear response of simple structures, including application of a damage excitation to a healthy structure and perturbation of the area moment of inertia. In this work, the two methods are investigated further, and it is established under what circumstances the methods are identical. Damage signatures are obtained for this formulation and compared to experimental data. A summary is provided of the diffculties which must be overcome to permit validation with experimental data. &copy; 2015, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. All Rights Reserved.},

	Abstract = {Bending fatigue life behaviors of direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) and cold-rolled Nickel (Ni) Alloy 718 have been compared in this study. The work was motivated by the possibility of using DMLS manufacturing to improve functionality of hot section components in gas turbine engines. In other words, by using DMLS, features like cooling passages with enhanced functionality can be created in turbine blades and heat exchangers, leading to larger flight envelopes and improved specific fuel consumption (SFC). The work in this document focuses on assessing high cycle fatigue (HCF) behavior of DMLS Ni Alloy 718. DMLS specimens from two different suppliers were fatigued via a vibration-based bending technique, and compared to published rotating bending behavior of cold-rolled Inconel 718 (Ni Alloy 718 composition). Tensile material properties of the DMLS specimens were observed as well. The comparisons conclude that fatigue and tensile properties may be sensitive to DMLS process parameters and post-sintering treatments, thus showing a need for process control optimization. Nonetheless, fatigue performance of DMLS Ni Alloy 718 compares well with rotating bending fatigue of cold-rolled Inconel 718.},

	Abstract = {Strain gages are commonly used to measure engine rotor operational stresses. Safe engine operation is ensured by setting safety limits on rotor airfoil mounted strain gages that monitor the dynamic response of the component. Traditionally, strain gage limits are generated utilizing nominal geometry obtained from an &ldquo;as-designed&rdquo; nominal model where finite element analysis (FEA) is used to compute the static and modal stresses. The predicted modal stresses of the cyclic analysis are used to optimize strain gage locations to ensure modal observational coverage, modal identification, and to determine maximum vibrational stress for each mode of interest. Strain gage limits are then produced for these optimal strain gage locations on the tuned finite element model. This described nominal geometry based process is subject to errors associated with airfoil mode shape variations caused by manufacturing deviations. This paper develops a new process based on as-manufactured geometry measurements from a high fidelity optical geometry collection system that obtains more accurate strain gage limits. It will be shown that due to the high variability of blade-to-blade geometry obtained from an optically scanned rotor that the strain gage limits can vary significantly between blades. This will be demonstrated by analyzing a mistuned IBR on a sector by sector basis. The approach utilized in this paper has the capability to more accurately place strain gages on responsive blades to ensure safe engine operation during testing. &copy; 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

	Abstract = {An experimental procedure for qualifying material properties from cyclically worked parts was investigated in support of aging gas turbine engines and digital twin initiatives. For aging components, remanufacturing or repair efforts are necessary to sustain the life cycles of engines; and for digital twin, the virtual representation of a part requires accurate geometric and component material property measurement. Therefore, having an effective, non-destructive way to assess the material performance of parts is necessary. Since low cycle, low strain, mechanical testing is the ideal experimental approach for nondestructively assessing material properties, investigating the accuracy and trends of tensile properties of fatigue loaded parts was important. The fatigued parts used for this study were specimens tested according to the George Fatigue Method, and the materials observed were cold-rolled Inconel Alloys 625 and 718, and direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) Nickel Alloy 718. The tensile material properties were compared against pristine (non-fatigued) and published data. The comparison for the cold-rolled 625 and 718 results show an increase and a decrease, depending on rolling direction, of tensile strength due to the effects of fatigue cycles; however, the variation of the vibration affected tensile properties are all within one standard deviation of the pristine data. The comparisons of DMLS Nickel Alloys was conducted against two sets of alloys from different suppliers, and the results showed that the tensile properties are sensitive to DMLS manufacturing parameters and post-sintering processes. A digital twin related, nondestructive, material property determination technique is also discussed in this manuscript. The true alloy density was determined with the water displacement method, and elastic modulus is determined with an iterative Ritz method model.

	Abstract = {Two methods that explicitly model airfoil geometry surface deviations for mistuning prediction in integrally bladed rotors (IBRs) are developed by performing a modal analysis on different degrees of freedom (DOFs) of a parent reduced order model (ROM). The parent ROM is formulated with Craig-Bampton component mode synthesis in cyclic symmetry coordinates for an IBR with a tuned disk and airfoil geometric deviations. The first method performs an eigen-analysis on the constraint-mode DOFs that provides a truncated set of interface modes while the second method includes the disk fixed interface normal mode in the eigen-analysis to yield a truncated set of ancillary modes. Both methods can utilize tuned or mistuned modes, where the tuned modes have the computational benefit of being computed in cyclic symmetry coordinates. Furthermore, the tuned modes only need to be calculated once which offers significant computational savings for subsequent mistuning studies. Each geometric mistuning method relies upon the use of geometrically mistuned airfoil modes in the component mode framework to provide a very accurate ROM. Free and forced response results are compared to both the full finite element model (FEM) solutions and a traditional frequency-based approach used widely in academia and the gas turbine industry.

	Abstract = {The geometric mistuning problem is investigated for dual flow-path integrally bladed rotors (DFIBRs) by outlining two methods that explicitly account for blade geometry surface deviations. The methods result in reduced-order models (ROMs) that are a reduced form of a parent Craig-Bampton component mode synthesis (CB-CMS) model. This is accomplished by performing a secondary modal analysis on different degrees of freedom (DOF) of the parent model. The DFIBR is formulated in cyclic symmetry coordinates with a tuned disk and ring and blades with small geometric deviations. The first method performs an eigen-analysis on the constraint DOF that provides a truncated set of interface modes, while the second method includes the disk and ring fixed interface normal mode in the eigen-analysis to yield a truncated set of ancillary modes.

	Abstract = {New turbine engine designs requiring secondary flow compression often look to dual flow-path integrally bladed rotors (DFIBRs) since these stages have the ability to perform work on the secondary, or bypassed, flow-field. While analogous to traditional integrally bladed rotor stages, DFIBR designs have many differences that result in unique dynamic response characteristics that must be understood to avoid fatigue. This work investigates these characteristics using reduced-order models (ROMs) that incorporate mistuning through perturbations to blade frequencies. This work provides an alternative to computationally intensive geometric-mistuning approaches for DFIBRs by utilizing tuned blade mode reductions and substructure coupling in cyclic coordinates. Free and forced response results are compared to full finite element model (FEM) solutions to determine if any errors are related to the reduced-order model formulation reduction methods. It is shown that DFIBRs have many more frequency veering regions than their single flow-path integrally blade rotor (IBR) counterparts. Modal families are shown to transition between system, inner-blade, and outer-blade motion. Furthermore, findings illustrate that while mode localization of traditional IBRs is limited to a single or small subset of blades, DFIBRs can have modal energy localized to either an inner- or outer-blade set resulting in many blades responding above tuned levels. Lastly, ROM forced response predictions compare well to full FEM predictions for the two test cases shown.},

	Abstract = {Two deterministic mistuning models utilizing component mode synthesis methods are used in a Monte Carlo simulation to generate mistuned response distributions for a geometrically perturbed Integrally Bladed Rotor. The first method, a frequencyperturbation approach with a nominal mode approximation used widely in academia and industry, assumes airfoil geometric perturbations alter only the corresponding modal stiffnesses while its mode shapes remain unaffected. The mistuned response is then predicted by a summation of the nominal modes. The second method, a geometric method utilizing non-nominal modes, makes no simplifying assumptions of the dynamic response due to airfoil geometric perturbations, but requires recalculation of each airfoil eigen-problem. A comparison of the statistical moments of the mistuned response distributions and prediction error is given for three different frequency ranges and engine order excitations. Further, the response distributions are used for a variety of design and testing scenarios to highlight impacts of the frequency-based approach inaccuracy. Results indicate the frequency-based method typically provides conservative response levels. Copyright &copy; 2012 by ASME.},

	Abstract = {New geometric mistuning approaches for integrally bladed rotors (IBRs) are developed for incorporating geometric perturbations to a fundamental disk-blade sector, particularly the diskblade boundary, or connection. The developed Reduced Oder Models (ROMs) are formulated from a Craig-Bampton component mode synthesis (C-B CMS) framework that is further reduced by a truncated set of interface modes that are obtained from an eigen-analysis of the C-B CMS constraint degrees of freedom (DOFs). An investigation into using a set of tuned interface modes and tuned constraint modes for model reduction is then performed. A tuned mode approximation has the added benefit of being only calculated once which offers significant computational savings for subsequent analyses. Two configurations of disk-blade connection mistuning are investigated: as-measured principal component deviations and random perturbations to the inter-blade spacing. Furthermore, the perturbation sizes are amplified to investigate the significance of incorporating mistuned disk-blade connection. Free and forced response results are obtained for each ROM and each disk-blade connection type and compared to full finite element model (FEM) solutions. It is shown that the developed methods provide highly accurate results with a significant reduction in solution time compared to the full FEM. In addition, results indicate that the inclusion of a mistuned disk-blade connection becomes significant as the size of the geometric deviations at the connection become large.

	Abstract = {{Two deterministic mistuning models utilizing component mode synthesis
   methods are used in a Monte Carlo simulation to generate mistuned
   response distributions for a geometrically perturbed integrally bladed
   rotor. The first method, a frequency-perturbation approach with a
   nominal mode approximation used widely in academia and industry, assumes
   airfoil geometric perturbations alter only the corresponding modal
   stiffnesses while its mode shapes remain unaffected. The mistuned
   response is then predicted by a summation of the nominal modes. The
   second method, a geometric method utilizing non-nominal modes, makes no
   simplifying assumptions of the dynamic response due to airfoil geometric
   perturbations, but requires recalculation of each airfoil eigen-problem.
   A comparison of the statistical moments of the mistuned response
   distributions and prediction error is given for three different
   frequency ranges and engine order excitations. Further, the response
   distributions are used for a variety of design and testing scenarios to
   highlight impacts of the frequency-based approach inaccuracy. Results
   indicate the frequency-based method typically provides conservative
   response levels.}},

	Abstract = {A new method is presented for identifying the local stiffness of a structure from vibration test data. The method is based on a projection of the experimentally measured flexibility matrix onto the strain energy distribution in local elements or regional superelements. Using both a presumed connectivity and a presumed strain energy distribution pattern, the method forms a well-determined linear least squares problem for elemental stiffness matrix eigenvalues. These eigenvalues are directly proportional to the stiffnesses of individual elements or superelements, including the cross-sectional bending stiffnesses of beams, plates, and shells, for example, An important part of the methodology is the formulation of nodal degrees of freedom as functions of the measured sensor degrees of freedom to account for the location offsets which are present in physical sensor measurements. Numerical and experimental results are presented which show the application of the approach to example problems.},

However, isolating the optimal residue estimation problem from the general realization problem affords several alternative strategies as compared to standard realization algorithms for structural dynamics identification. Primary among these are alternative techniques for handling data sets with large numbers of sensors using small numbers of reference point responses and the inclusion of terms that accurately model the effects of residual flexibility. The accuracy and efficiency of the present realization theory-based procedure is demonstrated for both simulated and experimental data.},

	Abstract = {A technique is presented for estimating the residual flexibility between nonexcited structural degrees of freedom from experimental structural vibration data. Using this method, one can include the residual flexibility estimated from modal measurements in the computation of measured flexibility for experiments with incomplete reciprocity, i.e., when the response and excitation measurement sensors are not fully collocated. The method can also be used to estimate the unknown entries in the residual flexibility matrix for experimental component mode synthesis when excitations are not provided at all interface degrees of freedom. A general solution is presented that contains an unknown positive semidefinite contribution. The general solution satisfies modal orthogonality in the limit that all of the structural degrees of freedom are instrumented and when the positive semidefinite contribution lies in a nullspace defined by the stiffness matrix and the modal flexibility. With a limited number of measurements, modal orthogonality is shown to be satisfied to the extent that the measured modes are preserved by static condensation. A rank-deficient solution is presented that allows the residual to be used in the computation of the flexibility matrix without further modeling assumptions. Numerical and experimental results that demonstrate the application of the method to both flexibility matrix convergence and experimental component mode synthesis are presented.},

	Abstract = {The problem of synthesizing reduced order linear models of vibrating structures for the design of fixed order dynamic feedback control is investigated, The present technique builds on a recently developed procedure for constructing an objective set of mass and stiffness matrices from measured modal parameters that are akin to the Craig-Bampton synthesized matrices obtained from finite element models (FEMs). The constructed mass and stiffness matrices are determined directly from the identification of experimental data, however, rather than through correlation or reconciliation of a FEM. A model truncation criterion is then applied to the identified minimum-order mass and stiffness model to satisfy certain observability/controllability requirements for the reduced model, Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique for synthesizing reduced-order controllers from system realizations of experimental data. The dynamic performance of the resulting closed-loop models is assessed using the known full-order structural dynamics and compared with existing model reduction techniques.},

	Abstract = {An experimental component mode synthesis procedure is presented that consists of an objective substructure-level modal identification, a minimum-order substructure realization expressed in terms of physical displacement and residual modal coordinates, and a global synthesis that exploits the physical form of the substructure realizations. The present experimental procedure is analogous to and approaches in its asymptotic limit to the well-known Craig-Bampton analytical component mode synthesis but is motivated by the physical form of the minimal-order mass and stiffness representation. The procedure is illustrated In a step-by-step manner via a numerical example and then demonstrated by applying it to an experimental component mode synthesis of assembling two truss structures into a global structure.},

	Abstract = {A new method for determining mass and stiffness matrices from modal test data is presented. The method builds on the identified modes and the mass-normalized mode shapes at the sensor locations and is not limited by either the number of driving points or measurement points, and so it is applicable to most general test settings. A mixed coordinate basis is defined for the mass and stiffness matrices which is analogous to the Craig-Bampton component mode synthesis method for finite element models. The resultant mass and stiffness are of minimal order necessary to span the measured modes, and the resulting generalized coordinates provide an objective basis for the test-derived matrices to be used as if they are component mode-synthesized finite element matrices. Inclusion of rigid-body modes and the relationship of the new method to traditional physical parameter computations based on mobility curves is considered. Examples of the method as applied to numerical and experimental data are provided.},

	Abstract = {Damage in structural members usually causes stiffness changes that could be linear or nonlinear. Opening and closing fatigue cracks are usually represented by a bilinear stiffness characteristic. This work describes damage identification approach that is based on the changes in statistical properties of randomdec signatures caused by the onset of nonlinearity. The approach is applied to acceleration data collected from a cracked beam. The results suggest that the method allows to detect the crack if excitation level is high enough. Practical difficulties encountered during implementation are also discussed.},

@article{SUNDERMEYER:1995,
	Abstract = {The weakly non-linear character of a cracked vibrating beam is exploited for the purpose of determining crack location, depth and opening load.  The approach is motivated by examining the response of a bilinear spring-mass system to excitation at two frequencies, such that the difference between the two frequencies is the resonant frequency of the system.  The numerically generated steady state response of the system clearly betrays the presence of the bilinear spring, even if the difference between the compressive and tensile stiffness is very small. The same idea is applied to a cracked beam forced at two frequencies, with the crack providing a local bilinear stiffness in the beam.  The numerically generated steady state response shows the effect of the opening and closing of the crack.  The prominence of this non-linear effect is then correlated with crack position and depth.  It is shown that the non-linear effect is maximized if a static load is also placed on the beam that would cause the crack to be on the verge of opening, thus determining the opening load.},

	Abstract = {A reduced order cyclic method was developed to compute limit-cycle oscillations for large, nonlinear, multidisciplinary 6 systems of equations. Method efficacy was demonstrated for two simplified models: a typical-section airfoil with nonlinear 7 structural coupling and a nonlinear panel in high-speed flow. The cyclic method was verified to maintain second-order temporal 8 accuracy, yield converged limit cycles in about 10 N iterates, and provide precise estimates of cycle frequency. This method was 9 projected onto a low-order space using a set of variables governing the amplitudes of empirically derived modes, which were 10 computed with the proper orthogonal decomposition. In this reduced order form, the cyclic Jacobian was greatly compressed, 11 allowing accurate limit cycle solutions to be very efficiently computed.},

	Abstract = {Flies, like all animals that depend on vision to navigate through the world, must integrate the optic flow created by self-motion with the images generated by prominent features in their environment. Although much is known about the responses of Drosophila melanogaster to rotating flow fields, their reactions to the more complex patterns of motion that occur as they translate through the world are not well understood. In the present study we explore the interactions between two visual reflexes in Drosophila: object fixation and expansion avoidance. As a fly flies forward, it encounters an expanding visual flow field. However, recent results have demonstrated that Drosophila strongly turn away from patterns of expansion. Given the strength of this reflex, it is difficult to explain how flies make forward progress through a visual landscape. This paradox is partially resolved by the finding reported here that when undergoing flight directed towards a conspicuous object, Drosophila will tolerate a level of expansion that would otherwise induce avoidance. This navigation strategy allows flies to fly straight when orienting towards prominent visual features.},

	Abstract = {The design, modeling, and testing of a morphing wing for flight control of an uninhabited aerial vehicle is detailed. The design employed a new type of piezoelectric flight control mechanism which relied on axial precompression to magnify control deflections and forces simultaneously. This postbuckled precompressed bending actuator was oriented in the plane of the 12 \% thick wing and mounted between the end of a tapered D-spar at the 40 \% chord and a trailing-edge stiffener at the 98\% chord. Axial precompression was generated in the piezoelectric elements by an elastic skin which covered the outside of the wing and served as the aerodynamic surface over the aft 70\% of the wing chord. A two-dimensional semi-analytical model based on the Rayleigh-Ritz method of assumed modes was used to predict the static and dynamic trailing-edge deflections as a function of the applied voltage and aerodynamic loading. It was shown that static trailing-edge deflections of +/- 3.1 deg could be attained statically and dynamically through 34 Hz, with excellent correlation between theory and experiment. Wind tunnel and flight tests showed that the postbuckled precompressed morphing wing increased roll control authority on a 1.4 meter span uninhabited aerial vehicle while reducing weight, slop, part-count, and power consumption.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes how post-buckled precompressed (PBP) piezoelectric bender actuators are employed in a deformable wing structure to manipulate its camber distribution and thereby induce roll control on a subscale UAV. By applying axial compression to piezoelectric bimorph bender actuators, significantly higher deflections can be achieved than for conventional piezoelectric bender actuators. Classical laminated plate theory is shown to capture the behavior of the unloaded elements. A Newtonian deflection model employing nonlinear structural relations is demonstrated to predict the behavior of the PBP elements accurately. A proof of concept 100 mm (3.94 '') span wing employing two outboard PBP actuator sets and a highly compliant latex skin was fabricated. Bench tests showed that, with a wing chord of 145 mm (5.8 '') and an axial compression of 70.7 gmf mm(-1), deflection levels increased by more than a factor of 2 to 15.25. peak-to-peak, with a corner frequency of 34 Hz (an order of magnitude higher than conventional subscale servoactuators). A 1.4 m span subscale UAV was equipped with two PBP morphing panels at the outboard stations, each measuring 230 mm (9.1 '') in span. Flight testing was carried out, showing a 38\% increase in roll control authority and 3.7 times greater control derivatives compared to conventional ailerons. The solid state PBP actuator in the morphing wing reduced the part count from 56 down to only 6, with respect to a conventional servoactuated aileron wing. Furthermore, power was reduced from 24 W to 100 mW, current draw was cut from 5 A to 1.4 mA, and the actuator weight increment dropped dramatically from 59 g down to 3 g.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a new class of flight control actuators using post-buckled precompressed (PBP) piezoelectric elements. These actuators are designed to produce significantly higher deflection and force levels than conventional piezoelectric actuator elements. Classical laminate plate theory (CLPT) models are shown to work very well in capturing the behavior of the free, unloaded elements. A new high transverse deflection model which employs nonlinear structural relations is shown to successfully predict the performance of the PBP actuators as they are exposed to higher and higher levels of axial force, which induces post-buckling deflections. A proof-of-concept empennage assembly and actuator were fabricated using the principles of PBP actuation. A single grid-fin flight control effector was driven by a 3.5 '' (88.9 mm) long piezoceramic bimorph PBP actuator. By using the PBP configuration, deflections were controllably magnified 4.5-fold with excellent correlation between theory and experiment. Quasi-static bench testing showed deflection levels in excess of +/- 6 degrees at rates exceeding 15 Hz. The new solid state PBP actuator was shown to reduce the part count with respect to conventional servoactuators by an order of magnitude. Power consumption dropped from 24 W to 100 mW, weight was cut from 108 to 14 g, slop went from 1.6. to 0.02. and current draw went from 5 A to 1.4 mA. The result was that the XQ-138 subscale UAV family experienced nearly a 4\% reduction in operating empty weight via the switch from conventional to PBP actuators, while in every other measure gross performance was significantly enhanced.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we present the first MEMS-based wing technology that we developed using titanium-alloy metal (Ti-6Al-4V) as wingframe and poly-monochloro-paua-xylylene (parylene-C) as wing membrane. With this new MEMS wing technology, we are able to produce light, but robust 3-D wings, optimized to utilize the flow separation to achieve a high lift coefficient as large as five times that of the fixed-wing aircraft. The use of MEMS technology enables systematic research in terms of repeatability, size control, and weight minimization of the wings. We also constructed a high quality low-speed wind tunnel with velocity uniformity of 0.5\% and speeds from 1 to 10 m/s. We have tested and have studied the unsteady-state aerodynamics of various types of MEMS-based and non MEMS-based wings. Finally, we built lightweight, palm-sized flapping-wing micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) with super capacitor-powered and battery-powered transmission systems and have demonstrated successful free flights with flight duration ranges from 5 to 18 s.

Results for the second moment responses of a linear single-degree-of-freedom system to this type of stochastic loading demonstrate a significant change in response characteristics due to a small uncertainty. A local phenomenon may last much longer and resonance may be smeared to a broad range. Integrated with wavelet transform, the proposed approach may be used to model a random process with non-stationary frequency content. Especially, it can be effectively used for Monte Carlo simulation to generate large size of samples that have similar characteristics in time and frequency domains as a pre-selected mother sample has. The technique has a great potential for the case where uncertainty study is warranted but the available samples are limited. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The paper provides an experimental study on the feasibility of base isolation for seismic protection of nonstructural secondary system such as sensitive instrumentation, computer equipment, communication network, HVAC facilities, and power transmission systems housed in nonisolated primary structures. Damages to these secondary systems, may result in significant social chaos and costly economic loss. A one-sixth-scaled three-story building model with a single-degree-of-freedom secondary system placed on its third floor is employed in this study, The secondary system is base-isolated by a laminated rubber bearing (LRB) base isolation system from the supporting floor. The ground motion input is simulated by a shaking table which generates three different types of signal including sweeping harmonic sinusoidal, the S00E component of the 1940 El Centro earthquake, and the simulated white noise. The experimental results demonstrate significant reduction in both displacement and acceleration responses of the secondary system by using the base isolation. Effects of parameters of the base isolation such as damping ratio and mass on its performance are also investigated. This study provides a valuable guideline for future work in this area and also verifies some previous analytical work by the authors (Hou et al., 2001). Secondary systems in a structure can be divided into two categories: structural and nonstructural. A thorough review of these types of systems and their response behavior under seismic loading has been presented by (Chen and Soong, 1988). In this paper only nonstructural secondary systems are the subject of the study. These systems include sensitive instrumentation, computer equipment, communication network HVAC facilities, and power transmission system that reside within a primary structure system. The huge investment made, the mission, and the critical role played by secondary systems in modern day warrant an effective protection strategy against earthquake-induced vibrations. Studies on employing base isolation techniques to protect primary structures have shown the ability of such techniques to limit dynamic response of structures in seismic disturbance (Kelley, 1986; and Ahmadi, 1988); this paper proposes the adoption of a base isolation mechanism for seismic protection of secondary systems and presents the experimental results achieved with this strategy in a scaled-down system designed without primary, structural isolation. This study provides a valuable guideline for future work in this area and also verifies some previous analytical work by the authors (Ghantous, 1991; and Samaha, 1992).},

	Abstract = {Health monitoring and damage detection strategies for base-excited structures typically rely on accurate models of the system dynamics. Restoring forces in these structures can exhibit highly non-linear characteristics, thus accurate non-linear system identification is critical. Parametric system identification approaches are commonly used, but require a priori knowledge of restoring force characteristics. Non-parametric approaches do not require this a priori information, but they typically lack direct associations between the model and the system dynamics, providing limited utility for health monitoring and damage detection. In this paper a novel system identification approach, the intelligent parameter varying (IPV) method, is used to identify constitutive non-linearities in structures subject to seismic excitations. IPV overcomes the limitations of traditional parametric and non-parametric approaches, while preserving the unique benefits of each. It uses embedded radial basis function networks to estimate the constitutive characteristics of inelastic and hysteretic restoring forces in a multi-degree-of-freedom structure. Simulation results are compared to those of a traditional parametric approach, the prediction error method. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of IPV in identifying highly non-linear restoring forces, without a priori information, while preserving a direct association with the structural dynamics.

	Abstract = {Modeling and identification of non-linear hysteretic systems are widely encountered in the structural dynamics field, especially for the hysteresis with slip. A model, called SL model, which can describe the pinching of most practical hysteresis loops perfectly was proposed by Baber and Noori (J. Eng. Mech. 111 (1985) 1010). A method of estimating the parameters of SL model on the basis of input-output data based on bootstrap filter was proposed by the writers. Bootstrap filter is a filtering method based on Bayesian state estimation and Monte Carlo method, which has the great advantage of being able to handle any functional non-linearity and system and/or measurement noise of any distribution. The standard bootstrap filter, however, is not time efficient, i.e., it is very time consuming and is not suitable for real-time applications. In this paper, previous work by the writers is extended to do the parameter estimation of SL model by a fast Bayesian bootstrap filtering technique. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the algorithm. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {In order to develop a fundamental understanding and the feasibility of SMA devices for passive vibration control, an undamped SDOF system with a pseudoelastic SMA restoring force is investigated to find the basic relationship between the shape of the hysteresis loop of SMA elements and their performance as a damping device. The dynamic characteristics of the device are evaluated by the steady-state response at the resonance point in order to focus on the damping effect. Dynamic analysis utilizing the equivalent linearization approach results in two major findings that, to the best of the authors' knowledge, have not yet been reported in the literature. These results which characterize the unique behavior of the SMA hysteresis include: (a) for a given excitation amplitude, the scale of the hysteresis loop, which is a measure of displacement and restoring force, needs to be adjusted so that the response sweeps the maximum loop but does not exceed it; (b) the ratio of the area confined within the hysteresis loop to the area of a corresponding envelope of triangular shape should be as large as possible. The results of this study would be quite useful not only as a guideline for the design of actual SMA devices, but also as a basis for the development of new autoadaptive materials in future.

	Abstract = {Most structural health monitoring and damage detection strategies utilize dynamic response information to identify the existence, location, and magnitude of damage. Traditional model-based techniques seek to identify parametric changes in a linear dynamic model, while non-model-based techniques focus on changes in the temporal and frequency characteristics of the system response. Because restoring forces in base-excited structures can exhibit highly non-linear characteristics, non-linear model-based approaches may be better suited for reliable health monitoring and damage detection. This paper presents the application of a novel intelligent parameter varying (IPV) modeling and system identification technique, developed by the authors, to detect damage in base-excited structures. This IPV technique overcomes specific limitations of traditional model-based and non-model-based approaches, as demonstrated through comparative simulations with wavelet analysis methods. These simulations confirm the effectiveness of the IPV technique, and show that performance is not compromised by the introduction of realistic structural non-linearities and ground excitation characteristics.

	Abstract = {Due to the complex nature of the excitation, and the inherent dynamics characteristics of restoring force of the base isolation systems, the response of base-isolated structures subject to strong earthquakes often experiences excursion into the inelastic range. Therefore, in designing base-isolated structures, the nonlinear hysteretic restoring force model of the base isolation system is frequently used to predict structural response and to evaluate structural safety. In this paper, the prediction error method system identification technique is used in conjunction with nonlinear state-space models for identification of a base-isolated structure. Using a variety of nonlinear restoring force models and bidirectional recorded seismic responses, several identification runs are conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the selected models. Several nonlinear restoring force models are utilized for the base-isolation system, including a multiple shear spring (MSS) model. Among all models used, results indicate that the trilinear hysteretic MSS model closely matches the actual hysteretic restoring force profile and time histories obtained directly from the observed data.},

	Abstract = {Chiropractic was defined by D.D. Palmer as ``a science of healing without drugs.'' About 60,000 chiropractors currently practice in North America, and, worldwide, billions are spent each year for their services. This article attempts to critically evaluate chiropractic. The specific topics include the history of chiropractic; the internal conflicts within the profession; the concepts of chiropractic, particularly those of subluxation and spinal manipulation; chiropractic practice and research; and the efficacy, safety, and cost of chiropractic. A narrative review of selected articles from the published chiropractic literature was performed. For the assessment of efficacy, safety, and cost, the evaluation relied on previously published systematic reviews. Chiropractic is rooted in mystical concepts. This led to an internal conflict within the chiropractic profession, which continues today. Currently, there are two types of chiropractors: those religiously adhering to the gospel of its founding fathers and those open to change. The core concepts of chiropractic, subluxation and spinal manipulation, are not based on sound science. Back and neck pain are the domains of chiropractic but many chiropractors treat conditions other than musculoskeletal problems. With the possible exception of back pain, chiropractic spinal manipulation has not been shown to be effective for any medical condition. Manipulation is associated with frequent mild adverse effects and with serious complications of unknown incidence. Its cost-effectiveness has not been demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt. The concepts of chiropractic are not based on solid science and its therapeutic value has not been demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt.},

	Abstract = {This work illustrates application of the minimum model error system identification method to obtain the nonlinear state space models of a fluttering panel. Identification using position and velocity data from forced response of the panel is presented here. The response was numerically simulated using two different discretization approaches: through finite differences and using the Galerkin's method. Data from two different parts of response time history were considered. First, data where transients due to initial conditions and the forcing were present were used for identification. Then, data when only transients due to forcing were present were used for identification. The models obtained using the forced response of the panel were able to capture the behavior of the true system relatively accurately. Identification of models of different sizes is also discussed. Reduced size models can be successfully created from the forced response data using the minimum model, error method. It is demonstrated that the number of degrees of freedom in the model attempted to be identified should be consistent with the number modes observed in the measurements. The response surface method was successfully applied to generate models for various flow regimes.},

	Abstract = {Convergence of finite element models is generally realized via observation of mesh independence. In linear systems invariance of linear modes to further mesh refinement is often used to assess mesh independence. These linear models are, however, often coupled with nonlinear elements such as CFD models, nonlinear control systems, or joint dynamics. The introduction of a single nonlinear element can significantly alter the degree of mesh refinement necessary for sufficient model accuracy. Application of nonlinear modal analysis [1,2] illustrates that using linear modal convergence as a measure of mesh quality in the presence of nonlinearities is inadequate. The convergence of the nonlinear normal modes of a simply supported beam modeled using finite elements is examined. A comparison is made to the solution of Boivin, Pierre, and Shaw [3]. Both methods suffer from the need for convergence in power series approximations. However, the finite element modeling method introduces the additional concern of mesh independence, even when the meshing the linear part of the model unless p-type elements are used [4]. The importance of moving to a finite element approach for nonlinear modal analysis is the ability to solve problems of a more complex geometry for which no closed form solution exists. This case study demonstrates that a finite element model solution converges nearly as well as a continuous solution, and presents rough guidelines for the number of expansion terms and elements needed for various levels of solution accuracy. It also demonstrates that modal convergence occurs significantly more slowly in the nonlinear model than in the corresponding linear model. This illustrates that convergence of linear modes may be an inadequate measure of mesh independence when even a small part of a model is nonlinear.},

	Abstract = {To evaluate the effectiveness of high-damping materials as candidate fill materials for hollow fan blades, test specimens in the form of flat trapezoidal plates were designed and mounted as cantilevers. An open-ended cavity of uniform thickness comprised 71\% of the planform area. Two viscoelastic materials were developed and used as fillers. Each was modified for reduced density and then aged after application to simulate the influence of 4000 service hours at a characteristic mission profile. Values of the loss factor (reciprocal of the system quality factor) determined from the resonant responses of the filled plates in the first bending, first torsion, and second bending modes at 75 degrees C (170 degrees F) were found to be in the range of eta = 0.025-0.045 (Q = 22-40), eta = 0.06 (Q = 16), and eta = 0.09-0.11 (Q = 9-11) for the three modes, respectively, which is an improvement of 1.5 to 2 orders of magnitude over values measured with the unfilled specimens. A finite element analysis, using temperature and frequency dependent properties of the filler material as determined by separate tests, showed satisfactory agreement with the observed values for temperatures up to 120 degrees C (250 degrees F). This study confirmed that the addition of viscoelastic filler to a hollow plate can increase damping significantly and that the system response could be predicted by finite element analysis. Through appropriate selection of the filler material, such systems can be designed to have maximum damping at a desired specific combination of temperature and frequency.},

	Abstract = {The method of Modal Strain Energy (MSE) enables predictions of modal loss factors for vibrating systems from finite element analyses without evaluation of a complex-valued frequency response or a complex-valued frequency. While the method is simple, some error results; especially if the dissipative material has the high loss factor characteristic of materials added to increase system damping. Several methods for reducing this error through modifications to MSE have been suggested. In this work, the exact loss factor for a simple mechanical system is found. The method of Modal Strain Energy (MSE) is then used to find the loss factor for that prototype system and errors are evaluated in terms of system parameters. Comparisons are also made to predictions with several modifications to MSE. A modification due to Rongong is found to provide significant improvement. The use of this modification together with MSE is shown to lead to lower and upper bounds for the system loss factor. As the prototype system is shown to be mechanically equivalent to constrained layer damping configurations, the findings are applicable to the analysis and design of optimized sandwich beams, plates, and damping tapes. Results are given for beams and plates with constrained layer treatments.},

Application of the method requires only that the modulus, thickness, and density of the substrate, constraining layer, and shear layer be known, as well as either the eigenvalue or natural frequency for the plate of aspect ratio and boundary condition to which the constrained layer treatment is to be applied.

	Abstract = {System damping for a single mode in resonance is often estimated from a measurement of the bandwidth of the frequency response function. While the bandwidth is customarily measured between the half-power frequencies, it is also possible to choose any other fraction of the maximum amplitude. If the damping is linear i.e., if the loss factor is independent of amplitude, the same damping will be found with any such choice. While intuition might suggest that the damping of a nonlinear system would be better estimated from a bandwidth taken closer to the maximum amplitude, this is shown to be false.},

	Abstract = {Some efficient strategies for the active control of vibrations of a beam structure using piezoelectric materials are described. The control algorithms have been implemented for a cantilever beam model developed using finite element formulation. The vibration response of the beam to an impulse excitation has been calculated numerically for the uncontrolled and the controlled cases. The essence of the method proposed is that a feedback force in different modes be applied according to the vibration amplitude in the respective modes i.e., modes having lesser vibration may receive lesser feedback. This weighting may be done on the basis of either displacement or energy present in different modes. This method is compared with existing methods of modal space control, namely the independent modal space control (IMSC), and modified independent modal space control (MIMSC). The method is in fact an extension of the modified independent space control with the addition that it proposes to use the sum of weighted multiple modal forces for control. The proposed method results in a simpler feedback, which is easy to implement on a controller. The procedure is illustrated for vibration control of a cantilever beam. The analytical results show that the maximum feedback control voltage required in the proposed method is further reduced as compared to existing methods of IMSC and MIMSC for similar vibration control. The limitations of the proposed method are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Accurate prediction of sonic fatigue response is important in designing aircraft structures for long life. Early prediction methods were based on single-mode, linear models which were not accurate for complex structures or large-amplitude response levels. Direct time integration of full, nonlinear, finite element models can provide accurate results, but at a prohibitive computational expense. Recent methods reduce the finite element model to a low-order system of nonlinear modal equations. The modal equations can then be integrated in the time domain. The computational burden is greatly reduced and an accurate response prediction can be accomplished. In this paper, several methods used to construct the nonlinear modal models are compared using a clamped-clamped beam as an example problem. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {High cycle fatigue in jet engine blades is caused by excessive vibration. Understanding the dynamic response of the bladed disk system is important in determining vibration levels. Modal testing is a useful tool in understanding the dynamic behavior of structures. However, modal tests are not conducted on bladed disks because of the difficulties involved. One problem is that the overall dynamic behavior is sensitive to small perturbations. Another problem is that multiple inputs and high-resolution techniques are required to separate modes that are nearly repeated. Two studies of engine blade response were recently completed in which bench modal tests were successfully performed on simplified fan models. The modal test procedures for the first study were successful in extracting the modal parameters. But the tests in the second study were more demanding. Ultimately, an approach was devised that accurately extracted the modal parameters. This paper describes the challenges and the evolution of the test procedures. (C) 2001 Academic Press.},

	Abstract = {A model of a mistuned bladed disk is created and then analyzed for both free and forced vibrations. The model consists of structurally damped, Euler-Bernoulli beams connected at one end using springs, The model is useful in the prediction of the response of a turbine engine bladed disk in which only some of the blades have added damping. (This situation arises in the experimental analysis of damping treatments.) The natural frequencies and eigenfunction sets are obtained by assuming harmonic motion and imposing the boundary conditions. The eigensolution was verified using a small NASTRAN model. The forced response due to phased, harmonic tip loads is obtained by modalizing the equations using a technique recently developed by Turcotte (Turcotte, J, S., ``An Analytical Model for the Forced Response of Cyclic Structures,'' Journal of Sound and Vibration, Vol, 209, No. 3, 1.998, pp, 531-536), The physical response is obtained as a function of forcing frequency by truncation and summation of the modal responses. The results are in general agreement with those of existing discrete models but have much greater detail.},

	Abstract = {A qualitative comparison between a piezoelectric vibration absorber and a constrained layer damping treatment is presented. Piezoelectric materials convert mechanical strains into electrical charge. Dissipation of the charge results in attenuation of vibration. The damping is concentrated to a single mode by constructing a piezoelectric absorber. The damped vibration absorber is comprised of the piezoelectric material and a passive electronic shunt. Previous research has applied the piezoelectric absorber to one-dimensional structures. This paper applies the absorber to a two-dimensional planar problem. The simple mathematical description of the absorber is modified for the two-dimensional problem. An analytical means of estimating the effectiveness of the piezoelectric absorber is derived. The effectiveness is estimated for an electronics chassis box subjected to random excitation. A typical constrained layer damping treatment is also analytically designed for the problem. The piezoelectric absorber and the constrained layer damping treatment are experimentally applied to identical boxes. Results show that the piezoelectric absorber can provide vibration suppression comparable to that obtained by the constrained layer damping treatment.},

	Abstract = {With the aim of seeking the diagnostic features of a rotor crack, the dynamic responses of a cracked rotor in the subcritical, trans-critical and super-critical regions of operation are investigated in this paper, based on the analysis of the vibration signatures collected during the acceleration process. A few feasible methods based on the holo-spectral analysis technique are specially developed for investigating the transient vibration behaviour of a cracked rotor in a more detailed way. The experimental results show that, because the Proposed methods provide much more detailed and distinguishable characteristics for diagnosis, they are really effective for capturing incipient transverse cracks in a rotor. Moreover, these methods are also generic and applicable to all high-speed rotating machines such as turbines, generators, motors and pumps. In addition, the crack breathing behaviour in the super-critical region is fia-ther investigated by experiments, from which a new research subject is brought forward. This is very helpful for correctly understanding the vibration characteristics of a cracked rotor. The research work in this paper makes a marked contribution for the detection of the incipient crack and has important significance for obviating catastrophic machine failures.},

@article{Meng:2000ss,
	Abstract = {This paper investigates the stability and the stability degree of a cracked flexible rotor supported on different kinds of journal bearings. It is found that no matter what kinds of bearings are used the unstable zones caused by rotor crack locate always within die speed ratio of 2/N(1 - DeltaK(xi)/4)<<Omega><2/N when gravity parameter W-g > 1.0; and locate always within the speed ratio of 2 Omega (alpha)/N(1 - DeltaK(xi)/4)<<Omega><2<Omega>(alpha) when W-g < 0.1where always the crack stiffness ratio, N = 1,2,3,4,5,... and <Omega>(alpha) = (1+1/2 alpha)(1/2). When 0.1<W-g<1.0, there is a region where no unstable zones caused by rotor crack exist. Outside the crack ridge zones, the rotor crack has almost no influence on the system's stability firm stability degree; while within the crack ridge zones, the stability and the stability degree depend both on the crack and the system's parameters. In some cases, the system may still be stable even though the crack is very large. For small gravity parameter (W-g < 0.1), the mass ratio a has a large influence on the position of the unstable region, but its influence on the stability degree is small. The influence of fired Sommerfeld number S-0 on the stability degree of the cracked rotor is small, although S-0 has a large influence on the stability degree of the uncracked rotor.},

@article{Bently:1997yo,
	Abstract = {A rotor system with two orthogonal lateral and two angular (torsional) degrees of freedom is considered. The rotor has asymmetry of the lateral stiffness and is laterally loaded with a constant radial force and a rotating unbalance. Constant driving and load torques are applied to the rotor. The important part of the research includes an analysis of ''snapping'' action, when, during rotation, the rotor experiences a peak of torsional acceleration. This occurs when the ''strong stiffness'' axis of the anisotropic rotor passes under the axis of the sideload. The numerical simulation of the analytical model exhibits a snapping (accelerated) torsional response of the rotor at twice synchronous frequency (2x), and it is especially pronounced at IX and 2X torsional resonances. The snapping response can initiate a rotor crack in the area of stress concentration, can stimulate existing crack propagation, and can be a cause of the coupling failure. The analytical results are obtained by the Averaging Method application. They confirm the numerical results and show the possibility of combination resonance occurrences. The synchronous dynamic stiffness for the frequency range around IX lateral resonance is analytically obtained The specific shape of the quadrature dynamic stiffness component can serve as a shaft crack indicator and can be used for early detection of a lateral crack on the rotor.},

	Abstract = {Detection of a rotor crack based on the nonlinear vibration diagnosis using harmonic excitation-force is investigated. The open-close mechanism of crack is firstly modeled by a piecewise linear function. In addition, another approximation crack model using a power series Junction that is convenient for the theoretical analysis is used. When the power series function crack model is used, the equations of motion of a cracked rotor have linear and nonlinear parametric terms. In this paper a harmonic excitation force is applied to the cracked rotor and its excitation frequency is swept, and the nonlinear resonances due to crack are investigated. The occurrence of various types of nonlinear resonances due to crack are clarified, and types of these resonances, their resonance points, and dominant frequency component of these resonances are clarified numerically and experimentally Furthermore, nonlinear theoretical analyses are performed for these nonlinear resonances, and it is clarified that the amplitudes of these nonlinear resonances depend on the nonlinear parametric characteristics of rotor crack. These results enable us to detect a rotor crack without stopping the system during on-line operation.},

Problems involving damped second order partial differential equations with unbounded input coefficients are discussed in the context of a variational formulation Theoretical, computational and experimental aspects of a smart structural system are successfully considered here, illustrating the importance of the proposed procedure in providing accurate models for identification and control. Approximation techniques are introduced and convergence arguments are presented rigorously. Numerical results of parameter estimation procedures are given and experimental data are used to test our computational results.},

	Abstract = {This paper considers an accepted model of the metal cutting process dynamics in the context of an approximate analysis of the resulting non-linear differential equations of motion. The process model is based upon the established mechanics of orthogonal cutting and results in a pair of non-linear ordinary differential equations which are then restated in a form suitable for approximate analytical solution. The chosen solution technique is the perturbation method of multiple time scales and approximate closed-form solutions are generated for the most important non-resonant case. Numerical data are then substituted into the analytical solutions and key results are obtained and presented. Some comparisons between the exact numerical calculations for the forces involved and their reduced and simplified analytical counterparts are given. It is shown that there is almost no discernible difference between the two thus confirming the validity of the excitation functions adopted in the analysis for the data sets used, these being chosen to represent a real orthogonal cutting process. In an attempt to provide guidance for the selection of technological parameters for the avoidance of primary chatter, this paper determines for the first time the stability regions in terms of the depth of cut and the cutting speed co-ordinates.

	Abstract = {A self-tuning piezoelectric vibration absorber is presented. A piezoelectric absorber, similar to a mechanical vibration absorber. has to be tuned to a particular structural vibration mode in order to be effective. The absorber presented here will tune itself to a particular mode and track that mode if it varies in frequency. Design of the aborber consists of a pair of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) tiles attached to the structure and shunted by an inductor-resistor circuit. This produces an electrical resonance that can be tuned to the desired structural mode by a simple control system. The absorber is experimentally demonstrated on a cantilevered beam. The experiments include an examination of the response of the absorber to an abrupt change in system parameters.},

	Abstract = {The paper is an expository contribution on the subject of structural system identification, measured signal processing and their applications to model-based structural health detection. The materials covered in this paper are by and large extracted from the three theses of the first three authors. The paper focuses on the state-space oriented system identification theory as specialized to structural dynamics governing equations of motion, a judicious use of wavelet transformation techniques for extracting impulse response functions, various input-output combinations for multi-input and multi-output problems, robust ways of identifying both proportional and non-proportional damping parameters, and the use of localized identification theory for damage detection from measured response data. The authors then offer several outstanding challenges in structural system identification theory and their applications. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {This paper deals with a novel shunt circuit, which is capable of suppressing multimode vibration amplitudes by using a pair of piezoceramic patches. In order to describe the characteristic behaviors of a piezoelectric damper connected with a series and a parallel resistor-negative capacitor branch circuit, the stiffness ratio and loss factor with respect to the non-dimensional frequency are considered. The mechanism of the shunt damper is also described by considering a shunt voltage constrained by shunt impedance. To obtain a guideline model of the piezo/beam system with a negative capacitive shunting, the governing equations of motion are derived through the Hamilton's principle and a piezo sensor equation as well as a shunt-damping matrix is developed. The theoretical analysis shows that the piezo/beam system combined with a series and a parallel resistor-negative capacitor branch circuit developed in this study can significantly reduce the multiple-mode vibration amplitudes over the whole structural frequency range.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a new design methodology for the piezoelectric shunt damping system and applies to the multimode vibration suppression of a CD-ROM drive base. Admittance is introduced to predict the performance of the piezoelectric shunt damping. Numerical admittance obtained by commercial finite element code, ANSYS, is compared with experimentally measured one and the effectiveness of the model is verified. Multimode piezoelectric shunt damping is experimentally realized based on the target mode and frequencies obtained by the admittance analysis. The vibration of the CD-ROM drive base is effectively reduced by activating the piezoelectric shunt circuits. The experimental results presented in this work prove that admittance of the piezoelectric structure is capable of predicting the performance of piezoelectric shunt damping. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Ozer:2003qv,
	Abstract = {Two methods are presented to determine optimal inductance and resistance values of the shunt circuit across a piezoceramic material, which is bonded to a simply supported plate in order to minimize sound radiation from the plate. The first method (DH) makes use of den Hartog's damped vibration absorber principle. The second method (SM) uses the Sherman Morrison matrix inversion theorem. The effectiveness of each method is compared with regard to minimizing total acoustic sound-power radiation and acoustic pressure at a point. Optimization algorithms and case studies are presented using a linearized model for the piezoceramic and using a nonlinear model for the piezoceramic that accounts for the inherent dielectric hysteresis. Case studies demonstrate that the second method (SM) results in superior performance, under both linear and nonlinear system assumptions. Studies also illustrate that, if the nonlinearity in the system is significant, it must be incorporated in the optimization process. (C) 2003 Acoustical Society of America.},

@article{Smallwood:2003fk,
	Abstract = {A product model, in which {x(t)}, is the product of a slowly varying random window, {w(t)}, and a stationary random process, {g(t)}, is defined. A single realization of the process will be defined as x(t). This is slightly different from the usual definition of the product model where the window is typically defined as deterministic. An estimate of the energy (the zero order temporal moment, only in special cases is this physical energy) of the random process, {x(t)}, is defined as
m(0)=integral(-infinity)(infinity)|x(t)|(2)dt=integral(-infinity)(infinity)|w(t)g(t)|(2)dt
Relationships for the mean and variance of the energy estimates, m(0), are then developed. It is shown that for many cases the uncertainty (4pi times the product of rms duration, D-t, and rms bandwidth, D-f) is approximately the inverse of the normalized variance of the energy. The uncertainty is a quantitative measure of the expected error in the energy estimate. If a transient has a significant random component, a small uncertainty parameter implies large error in the energy estimate. Attempts to resolve a time/frequency spectrum near the uncertainty limits of a transient with a significant random component will result in large errors in the spectral estimates.},

	Abstract = {A wear-resistant, corrosion-resistant and heat-resisting steel was manufactured and tested. The development of this steel was carried out on the basis of high speed steels, with the aim of hardening the matrix by transformation and precipitation. The alloy chemistry was chosen according to the weldability, temper resistance and the wear values obtained on turning. The melting and casting process, welding conditions, the hardness on hard facing other materials, hardness and microstructure of the different layers in a multilayer weld, hardness obtained on tempering and annealing, hot hardness and the physical properties of the optimized material corresponding to S0-18-1-13 are reported. The possible applications of these materials are discussed.},

	Abstract = {A second-order perturbation theory is developed for the response of perturbed, undamped, nongyroscopic dynamical systems, where the perturbations arise from small changes in the system mass and stiffness coefficients. The solution is based upon the eigensolution of the unperturbed system and the perturbations in the mass and stiffness coefficients. The object is to obtain the eigensolution of the perturbed system without repeating the original computation cycle. This work is of particular importance for large-order systems for which an eigensolution analysis is costly and time-consuming.},

The expected domestic content of Sizewell B is in fact now very much higher than was originally envisaged. This is because UK manufacturing standards have improved markedly in such areas as quality control, sophistication of machine tools, cleanliness, and so on.},

The response is in terms of complex quantities, which is likely to cause computational difficulties as the order of the system increases. This paper extends the approach to the case of external damping, which is characterized not only by symmetric coefficients multiplying velocities but also by skew symmetric coefficients multiplying displacements, where the latter terms are known as circulatory. A numerical example is presented.},

	Abstract = {Inclusion of rotational effects is critical for the accuracy of the predicted system characteristics, in almost all system modelling studies. However, experimentally derived information for the description of one or more of the components for the system will generally not have any rotational effects included in the description of the component. The lack of rotational effects has long affected the results from any system model development whether using a modal-based approach or an impedance-based approach. Several new expansion processes are described herein for the development of FRFs needed for impedance-based system models. These techniques expand experimentally derived mode shapes, residual modes from the modal parameter estimation process and FRFs directly to allow for the inclusion of the necessary rotational dof. The FRFs involving translational to rotational dofs are developed as well as the rotational to rotational dof. Examples are provided to show the use of these techniques.},

	Abstract = {The correlation of finite element models of structural systems with the experimental modal parameters requires the user to be able to expand the reduced test model data to the full analytical model. To properly accomplish this, a reduced model has to be developed from the finite element model and a mapping matrix is determined for the expansion process. Also these reduced models are used to efficiently extract eigenparameters for large structural models. The ability of the reduced model to reflect the proper system dynamics is important in the above techniques. Therefore, a study of reduced model concepts such as static condensation, dynamic condensation, general dynamic reduction, an extended Guyan reduction, an improved reduced system and a system equivalent reduction - expansion process will be made against a reference solution and the exact reduced system.},

	Abstract = {Generally, for nonlinear response analysis involving discrete nonlinear elements such as typical mounting connections, the physical finite element mass, damping and stiffness matrices are used in a direct integration algorithm to form the nonlinear response solution. Due to the large size of these matrices, forced nonlinear response analysis requires significant computational resources. Using a mode superposition technique, the response of the structure can be characterized at particular time intervals by the linear superposition of the modes of the system. As different discrete nonlinear elements are activated in the system, the modal character of the structure is updated using a structural dynamic modification process. Using the modification process, the modal character of the structure can be updated very efficiently and then, the response using mode superposition techniques can be estimated very efficiently even though nonlinearities exist. This technique, referred to as the Modal Modification Response Technique, is illustrated using simple structures that contain discrete nonlinear connection/gap elements and is compared to traditional direct integration techniques. Advantages and limitations of this technique are discussed.},

The theory of the structural dynamic modification process is reviewed to give additional insight into the interpretation of the modification matrices relative to truncation. Several simple examples are given to show how truncation affects the results of the modification process. In general, the following conclusions are drawn concerning structural dynamic modification and truncation. The accuracy of the results are heavily dependent on the collection of modes used in the original modal data base. The results are affected by the type of modification and the particular degrees of freedom that are attached in the modification process. The final resulting system modes are not all affected equally by the truncation of modes.},

	Abstract = {The standard symmetric beam is used extensively in modeling of structures for modal correlation and model updating. Some of the difficulty in the processing is that the finite element models used as baseline do not contain sufficient detail such as accurate modes at higher frequencies and edge effects at joint connections. The modified beam element is developed as an equivalent Timoshenko beam including transverse shear effects and mass moments of inertia allowing better dynamics at higher modes. To include edge effects for joint connections, modified moment transfer elements are used at both ends of the beam element and in the two principal bending directions. These moment transfer elements are then condensed into the standard beam element using a reduction technique. This results in the development of a moment transfer efficiency factor that can vary between zero and one implying a pin joint to a full moment transfer joint respectively. The initial moment transfer factors can be determined from static deflection patterns or eigenparameters. The modified element is then ideally suited for tuning and correlating models with questionable joint connections.},

	Abstract = {The inverse dynamic design technique presented herein tunes a structural model to achieve a prespecified frequency response at certain critical points of the structure. The technique can correct structural models based on vibration response test data and also can optimize structural design. The technique works by partitioning the second-order matrix equations of motion into assigned and auxiliary degrees of freedom and then performs a parameter optimization to assign new frequency response data to the model. Design variable linking, symbolic or sparse matrix solutions, and closed-form gradients are used to streamline the computations. The technique still requires a large amount of computation, and thus is most applicable to small or moderate size dynamic models, such as coarse mesh prototype models, or models with repeated geometry or symmetry. Two small order example problems illustrate the technique. The first example completely corrects the stiffness matrix of a corrupted analytical model using simulated measured (exact) frequency response data. The second example flattens the first resonance peak of a truss structure by assigning a specified partial frequency response to the model.},

This allows the nonlinear normal mode method to be applied to the feedback control problem providing a new method of controlling nonlinear multiple-degree-of-freedom systems. The proposed method uses a transformation proposed earlier for homogeneous systems written in state-space form. The coordinate transformation for the forcing vector is defined here in state space and related to the physical coordinate system. The result is a pseudomodal decoupling transformation of a nonlinear inhomogeneous system. Although interesting in its own statement, this transformation also provides a nonlinear modal control scheme. This result is applied to a known coupled two degree of-freedom oscillator with a cubic stiffness term. The results illustrate the design of a nonlinear modal control law.},

	Abstract = {The nonlinear panel flutter problem solved by Dowell in 1966 is used to investigate the new application of the proper orthogonal decomposition model reduction technique to aeroelastic analysis. Emphasis is placed on the nonlinear structural dynamic equations with nonconservative forcing modeled assuming a supersonic, inviscid flow. Here the aeroelastic coupled equation is presented in discrete form using a finite difference approach, and subsequently in state space form, to be integrated as a set of first order differential equations. In this paper a POD approach is developed for generalized second-order differential equations; however, the application of POD to the governing equations in state space form is also discussed. This study compares the results and effectiveness of the model reduction technique for integration of the full set of degrees of freedom. The solution is compared to Dowell's classic results which forms the base reference for the model reduction study. The reduced order model is then created from the full simulation model. Accuracy of the solution, reduced computational time, limits of stability and the strengths and weaknesses of the model reduction are investigated.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents the first known analytical solution for vibrations of a polarly orthotropic Mindlin sectorial plate with simply supported radial edges. The solution is a series solution constructed using the Frobenius method and exactly satisfies not only the boundary conditions along the radial and circular edges, but also the regularity conditions at the vertex of the radial edges. The moment and shear force singularities at the vertex are exactly considered in the solution. The correctness of the proposed solution is confirmed by comparing non-dimensional frequencies of isotropic plates obtained from the present solution with published data obtained from a closed-form solution. This paper also investigates the effects of elastic and shear moduli on the vibration frequencies of the sectorial plates with free or fix boundary conditions along the circumferential edge. A study is also carried out about the influence of elastic and shear moduli on the moment and shear force singularities at the plate origin (r = 0) for different vertex angles. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Huang1996,
	Abstract = {A new approach to analyzing the dynamic coupling between shaft torsion and blade bending of a rotating shaft-disk-blade unit is introduced. The approach allows the shaft to vibrate freely around its rotation axis instead of assuming a periodic perturbation of the shaft speed that may accommodate the shaft flexibility only to a limited extent. A weighted residual method is applied and the receptances at the connections of blades and shaft-disk are formulated. Numerical examples are given for cases with between two and six symmetrically arranged blades. The results show not only coupling between the shaft, disk, and blades, but also coupling between individual blades where the shaft acts as a rigid support and experiences no torsional vibration. The blade-coupling modes occurred only in repeated frequencies. Finally, the effect of shaft speed oil the modal frequencies was investigated. Plots illustrating the occurrence of critical speeds and flutter instabilities are presented.},

@article{Dosch1992ce,
	Abstract = {A technique has been developed which allows a single piece of piezoelectric material to concurrently sense and actuate in a closed loop system. The motivation behind the technique is that such a self-sensing actuator will be truly collocated and has applications in active and intelligent structures, such as vibration suppression. A theoretical basis for the self-sensing actuator is given in terms of the electromechanical constitutive equations for a piezoelectric material. In a practical implementation of the self-sensing actuator an electrical bridge circuit is used to measure strain. The bridge circuit is capable of measuring either strain or time rate of strain in the actuator. The usefulness of the proposed device was experimentally verified by actively damping the vibration in a cantilever beam. A single piezoceramic element bonded to the base of the beam functioned both as a distributed moment actuator and strain sensor. Using a rate feedback control law, the first mode of vibration was suppressed, reducing the settling from 35 seconds to 2.5 seconds. Using a positive position feedback law the first two modes of vibration were suppressed; the first mode settling time was reduced from 35 to 0.3 seconds and the second mode settling time was reduced from 7 seconds to 0.9 seconds.},
